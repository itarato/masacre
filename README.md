# Masacre

Silly top-view 2D shooting game.

![Demo](./misc/demo.webm)

Bugs:

- global scope is getting fishy - try to replace it with something injectable

Todo:

- new enemy spawned should be at a minimum distance from the player
- player died message
- enemy health bars

Idea:

- destroying map (like in worms)
- enemy driver flying out of the tank
- laser sight (temporarily)
