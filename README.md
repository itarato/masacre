# Masacre

Silly top-view 2D shooting game.

Bugs:

Missing:

- new enemy spawned should be at a minimum distance from the player
- player died message
- player deploying landmines
- enemy has health + rapid fire not being instant kill (but have smoke)

Idea:

- destroying map (like in worms)
- enemy spawning from factories on a time interval
- enemy driver flying out of the tank
-
