# Masacre

Silly top-view 2D shooting game.

Bugs:

- enemies can overlap each other
- player can get spawn (center) on a hit zone

Missing:

- moving smoke
- new enemy spawned should be at a minimum distance from the player
- player died message
- minimap
- player deploying landmines
- when reaching map borders - let the player get to the screen edge
-
